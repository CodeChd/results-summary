### What I learned

As I was working on this design, I was having trouble getting the circle inside the "Your Result" container to fade out because I was attempting to add a box shadow and a pseudo element. However, after some research, I discovered that there is a straightforward method using the linear gradient property that involves using transparency at the bottom and the color that is specified in this challenge.
